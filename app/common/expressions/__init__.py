    1. the answers provided so far for a submission

    When thinking about the answers for a submission in the context of an HTTP request, there are two sources for this:

    1. The current state of the submission from the database.
    2. Any form data in a POST request trying to update the submission.

    When evaluating expressions, we care about the latest view of the world, so form data POST'd in the current request
    should override any data from the database. We do this by starting with a dictionary of answers from the existing
    submission in the DB, and then (assuming the data passes some basic validation checks), we mutate the dictionary
    with answers from the current form submission (DynamicQuestionForm).
